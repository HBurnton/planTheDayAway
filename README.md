# It's time to **Plan the Day Away** ☀️🏙️

## Description

- What is it?

A man named Jon Franklin once said 
>Simplicity, carried to an an extreme, becomes elegance.

This is not to be confused with John Franklin, who played the creepy kid Isaac in Children of the corn who once said

>He Who Walks Behind The Rows did say, "I will send outlanders amongst you: a man and a woman. And these outlanders will be unbelievers and profaners of the holy. And the man will sorely test you, for he has great power, even greater than that of the Blue Man!"

And if what Jon with no 'h' said holds true, then this is the world's more elegant day planner ever created. 

- How does it work?

This application uses Moment.js to print the date at the top of the application and uses a 9 hour offset to draw rows for a 9 hour day from 9-5 during which every moment *must* be used productively because time is money and the wheels of capitalism don't move on their own own so chop chop. The application draws the appropriate amount of rows with text areas that store and retrieve data from local storage when save button is clicked and page is loaded.

Styling was all done though provided CSS and bootstrap with a minor tweak for a font-awesome icon link that was not working. 

- What does it solve?

Are you too busy to remember what you are busy with next? This day planner lets you write in your daily tasks, save them, and over the course of the day, the colors of the rows update show what progress has been made on your day.

- Problems Encountered

I happily did not encounter too many crushing problems with this project. Getting used to Moment.js and using JQuery were the biggest challenges but the documentation for each of them was incredibly helpful and (for Moment.js) easy to read. JQuery has a lot of resources out there for help even though it's site is...what it is.
